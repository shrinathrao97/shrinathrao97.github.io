Hiya, my friends call me Shri!

With a passion for both tech and gaming, I just finished degrees in both ATEC (Arts and Technology) and Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas.
I am looking for work in either the engineering or the game industry so I can build up my dream career in creative programming, leveraging both hemispheres of my passion. This blog site is my own little corner of the internet where I have showcased some excerpts of my work. Thanks for visiting - do stick around and I hope you enjoy my projects and views on game design and programming!

-Shri (Kshaya in Game Land)

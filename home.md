Hiya, my friends call me Shri!

Over the last 3-4 years I have been working at Uhnder Inc! A disruptive startup revolutionizing automotive and automated mobility with the world's first digital imaging radar-on-chip. There I do awesome work visualizing ROS and sensor output building [ProViz](https://proviz.online/) and other internal visualization tools. I also help with data analysis and craft demo experiences for customers!

Here is a link to my [resume](./_img/Shrinath_Resume.pdf).

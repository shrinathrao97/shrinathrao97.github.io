Hiya, call me Shri! I've just finished both my ATEC (Arts in Technology) and my Computer Science degrees at the University of Texas at Dallas and am currently seeking both engineering and game industry related opportunities!

This small blog is meant to be a corner of the internet to host everything from my work and projects, to small blurbs on things game design related.

Thanks for sticking around!

-Kshaya/Shri

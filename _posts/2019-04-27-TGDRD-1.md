What better way to celebrate a birthday than to talk about game design!

In this episode we talk about the basics, and go a little down the rabbit hole with game design. We had QA Tester, Hudson Bielstein from local Dallas studio BonusXP help us out a little with our talk today.

As an overview, today we covered the bad reasons to be in the industry, and some of the many skills and skillsets needed in the industry! We also went a little in depth about level design, mechanics design, and narrative design, and we detailed some design pillars and theories to keep in mind while making games! 

Come back next time where we'll hit part two of this presentation and detail even more design pillars and theories for those of you interesting in going to down the rabbit hole!

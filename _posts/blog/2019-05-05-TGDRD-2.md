Here we go a little down the rabbit hole about some visual and some other game design principles and we talk about why they're so important to think about while designing and making games! We also reference David Shaver's GDC talk on Level Design at GDC, look it up if you want to know more!

Under the same name ("The Game Design Rundown"), I plan to continue hosting friends and family from the entire Game Design/Development stack, from engineering to audio. Stay tuned for more updates! That said, TGDRD is signing off for the near furture due to everyone's busy schedule! Thanks everyone for your support!

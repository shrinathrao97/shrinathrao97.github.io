In this post we talk a little about flow theory in difficulty curves!

In game design we try to make sure we study how a player thinks and how we can leverage that to make interesting and “fun experiences.”

The first graph is describes a phenomenon and/or a theory called flow theory. Flow is a state of mind where everything just feels right- you’re “in the zone.” It’s being completely immersed in a subject or peice of content with full enjoyment and involement. To achive this state of immersion, game designers flucuate/ocillate the amount of skill/ability required and challenge given. Moving above the flow channel puts players in sense of anxiety, while moving below the channel puts them in a state of boredom.

The second graph describes what level designers and game designers call a difficulty curves. To get the players in a state of flow we follow the above formula to keep the game ineteresting and fun. We first teach the player a mechanic, or a skill and, we slowly ramp up the difficulty of challenges or puzzles to keep the game interesting. We finally peak at a boss fight or a pinnacle challenge and then fall back down to give the player time to recuperate.

This is a small class-based third-person shooter that helped me learn about multiplayer networking via the PhotonPUN2 tool.


If you'd like to play it, you'll need at least one friend to have an actual game, but it's open to go and try the characters! Be sure to select a team and a character before hitting the start button

Cypher started as an interesting game mode meant to help me understand and get started on learning things multiplayer related to games. Cypher had to get cut down quite a bit, being quite an ambitious Capstone project, I think I did learn a lot from making this small prototype. 

Polish and feel had to get compromised for the time it took me to wrap my head around multiplayer coding in Unity, but in its current prototyped state, it is a 2v2 3rd person, class-based shooter. The two playable characters are Eaglor- a ranged, squishy sniper type character with very little cqc potential, and Bonaparte- a heavy axe throwing tank with a lot of soaking potential. The classes were meant to encourage the use of communication and strategy to work together to eliminate the enemy.

What good is a cool shooter game without good maps? For this game, I also dipped into level design a little to find out how to create interesting symmetrical maps. I did some research, found some interesting maps that were symmetrical, but more importantly encouraging interesting encounters, strategy, and playstyles. To read more about my research here’s a <a href="https://shrinathrao97.github.io/blog/WIP-2">Blog Post</a> 

After researching, I tried to make a map of my taking inspiration from every one of the maps I read about and played. I also sent the map to some friends and some professors who taught me more about how to use space better and helped me see some potential flaws/bugs in the level.

The most important part about all of this was learning to do some networking stuff with PhotonPun2 and Unity. It was an interesting and very informative challenge. If you’d like to read about that, here’s a link to that <a href="https://shrinathrao97.github.io/blog/WIP-5">Blog Post</a>

Finally, I took this little experiment and presented it on capstone day to friends, family, faculty and the public at capstone day with a small info trailer, here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/05E04-Kdfa0">link!</a>

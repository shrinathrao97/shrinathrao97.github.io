FFXV's warpstrike is one of the coolest mobility abilities in my eyes. In order to learn a bit of Unreal Engine, I decided to try to recreate this ability!

I had very little experience with Unreal since in school we were taught to protoype with Unity and Game-maker. Realizing that I had been missing out on a lot, this project was a small attempt to familiarize myself with the unreal workflow being, fairly proficient with Unity. While the learning process was difficult, I think having a background in other engines helped me understand Unreal greatly and made this project possible.

Being a coder, I had very little experience with shader apart from making very basic ones like fresnel shaders to highlight players or enemies. This one was particularly complex to me as a beginner and was a fun problem to tackle. To help me, I used this free <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQG0SWv5lbw&list=PL78XDi0TS4lFlOVKsNC6LR4sCQhetKJqs">course</a>.

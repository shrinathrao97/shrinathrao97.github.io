So one of my favorite, if not favorite designers is Takahisa Taura, and on of my favorite studios is PlatinumGames. To me, playing and analysing a new Platinum Title is like a dream come true! It's no surprise then that Astral Chain was one of my favorite games of 2019. I did nothing but play that game and scrutinize it's combat system whenit released. Part of how I think the game keeps the player so engaged in it's free form combat, rather than just button mashing, is its system of reacting to enemies attacks. There are obviously many ways that it does this, but one simple way is the perfect dodge (as i've coined it). When th eplayer dodges within a frame window of the enemies attack, they do a perfect dodge and can counter attack with a devestating super cool looking corckscrew attack.

This project has me trying to do something similar, except I wanted to take that concept further- what if I added the ninja's realtime spell casting instead of that super cool corckscrew attack! And so there we go!

I normally try to write my blog posts after I've completed the project (or at least in cypher's case, certain parts of it). This time however, since this is a project that requires quite a bit of polish to even resemble something that feels good (and I've got nothing better to be doing in these dark times), I've decided to take a far more incremental approach to updating the blog. Expect updates frequently!

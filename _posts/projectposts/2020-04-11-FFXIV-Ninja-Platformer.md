After playing a bunch of FFXIV, I wanted to try to remake the ebb and flow of the Ninja's real time spell crafting system as a platformer

This project was another child of my playtime of FFXIV. After reading about and playing FFXIV's Ninja, I wanted to try and implement the Ten Chi Jin realtime spell crafting system and see how robust it would be in other settings. This prototype took that system and implemented it into a 2D style platformer (a sandbox in its current state) to test how that system would feel.

Given that for the capstone, we only have a set amount of time to plan and complete the project, I ran into some definite timeline and deadline problems. I started the game by using ProBuilder for my map creation and asset creation tool and essentially created the map in a separate unity project and moved the asset to my final project when the time was right. This method worked for something like a map but in terms of the characters, this idea of coding the character first, testing them locally and then converting them to be multiplayer capable was a little rough. The process took a lot longer than first imagined, and not only that, this being the first time I had done anything multiplayer-esque, the undertanding of Photon API and of the networking aspect (what goes into being an RPC, how to use them, how to handle lobbies etc...) all took much longer than anticipated. As such in terms of the production schedule, I had to make cuts for the capstone version of this game. Cypher will currently feature a 2v2 multiplayer free for all game mode that works instead of the 3v3 cypher game mode. While this is a little dissapointing, I do plan to take this idea further after capstone is done and maybe even re-write some of the code, characters and designs based on feedback I have gotten from testers and players.
